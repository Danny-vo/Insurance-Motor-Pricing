Based on past policies of 403,169 Motor insurance policies and their claim related information, our team came up with pricing model to price 10,000 new policies. 
The team with the lowest premium wins the policy as well as its potential loss, with a loss ratio of 100% as benchmark loss (bankruptcy), therefore the mission for each team was to setting the right premium for each policyholder using past information
Under the approach of Frequency and Severity, with the use of Zero Inflated Negative Binomial and Gamma Generalized Linear Model (GLM), our team conduct analysis and come up with rates for the new policies.
